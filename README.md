# ERC404 Cairo Implementation for StarkNet

## Overview

This repository hosts the Cairo implementation of ERC404 for StarkNet. Inspired by the [ERC404 Ethereum implementation](https://github.com/0xacme/ERC404/), this project adapts the experimental, mixed ERC20/ERC721 token standard to StarkNet's decentralized ZK Rollup environment.

## Setup

``curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh``

## Features

- Combines ERC20 (fungible) and ERC721 (non-fungible) token features.
- Supports native liquidity and fractionalization in StarkNet.
- Experimental and innovative approach to token standards.

## Warning

- This is experimental and unaudited code.
- Use at your own risk.
